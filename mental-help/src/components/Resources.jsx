        <p>
          5: Acknowledge FIVE things you see around you. It could be a pen, a spot on the ceiling, anything in your surroundings.
         <br></br>
          4: Acknowledge FOUR things you can touch around you. It could be your hair, a pillow, or the ground under your feet. 
         <br></br>
          3: Acknowledge THREE things you hear. This could be any external sound. If you can hear your belly rumbling that counts! Focus on things you can hear outside of your body.
         <br></br>
          2: Acknowledge TWO things you can smell. Maybe you are in your office and smell pencil, or maybe you are in your bedroom and smell a pillow. If you need to take a brief walk to find a scent you could smell soap in your bathroom, or nature outside.
         <br></br>
          1: Acknowledge ONE thing you can taste. What does the inside of your mouth taste likeâ€”gum, coffee, or the sandwich from lunch?
