        Mental Help is a website that allows you to log your feelings and cope
        with your emotions just like a bullet journal but digital. Keeping a
        journal is a good way to track your moods, energy levels, and mental
        health symptoms. Over time, journaling these things might help you
        recognize things that trigger depression and anxiety.
