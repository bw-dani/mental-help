# Project Overview

## Project Name

Mental Help!

## Project Description

Mental Help is a website that allows you to log your feelings and cope with your emotions just like a bullet journal but digital. Keeping a journal is a good way to track your moods, energy levels, and mental health symptoms. Over time, journaling these things might help you recognize things that trigger depression and anxiety.

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
